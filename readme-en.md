# R2 Web

📁 A lightweight, elegant, pure-browser Cloudflare R2 file manager. Everything happens right in your browser.

## Live Demo

Follow the [CORS setup guide](#1-configure-r2-bucket-cors) below, then visit **[r2.viki.moe](https://r2.viki.moe)** to start managing your R2 bucket immediately.

## Feedback

## Why R2 Web?

**Pain points with traditional solutions:**

- The official Cloudflare console is basic and cumbersome to use
- Third-party desktop clients require installation, painful across platforms
- CLI tools have a steep learning curve, not suited for quick ad-hoc tasks
- Other web tools aren't R2-focused, leaving gaps in features and experience

**What R2 Web solves:**

- Open in a browser and start immediately — zero installation, zero platform friction
- Drag & paste upload with image compression — save bandwidth and time
- PWA support — install to your home screen and use like a native app
- Pure client-side — your data never passes through a third-party server

**Where R2 Web falls short:**

- Very large file uploads (>300 MB) — use rclone or similar tools instead
- Complex permission management — use the official Cloudflare console
- Automated scripts — use the official SDK or CLI
- API integration — no backend; use the official SDK or call the R2 API directly

## Use Cases

- **File management**: Browse directories, rename, move, delete — easily handle large collections of files.
- **File browsing**: Built-in image/video/audio/text preview — quickly inspect content without downloading.
- **Private image hosting**: Drag & paste upload, auto compression, one-click copy as Markdown/HTML.

## Design Philosophy

- Zero build — source is the artifact, no compilation needed
- Zero framework — native Web APIs first, no framework dependency
- Zero backend — all logic runs in the browser, direct R2 API access
- Minimal aesthetic — black/white/grey + R2 orange, small radius, flat design
- Performance first — lazy loading, debounce/throttle, request caching
- Detail-oriented — smooth animations, immediate feedback, keyboard navigation

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure R2 Bucket CORS

In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to R2 → Bucket → Settings → CORS Policy and add:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://r2.viki.moe"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["authorization", "content-type", "x-amz-content-sha256", "x-amz-date", "x-amz-copy-source"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 86400
  }
]
```

> [!TIP]
> Self-hosting? Just replace `AllowedOrigins` with your own domain.

### 2. Enter Credentials

Visit [r2.viki.moe](https://r2.viki.moe), enter your R2 credentials, and connect. Credentials are stored only in your browser's localStorage and never uploaded anywhere.

### 3. Start Using

Browse files, drag & drop or press Ctrl+V to upload, right-click any file to rename, copy link, and more.

For image hosting, set a filename template with a hash placeholder, enable image compression for better performance and security.

## Tips & Tricks

### Filename Template Examples

- `[name]_[hash:6].[ext]` — original name + 6-char hash (default)
- `images/[date:YYYY/MM/DD]/[uuid].[ext]` — date-based directory structure
- `backup/[timestamp]-[name].[ext]` — timestamp-prefixed backup

### Config Share Link

Generate a "Config Share Link" or "Config QR Code" to quickly sync your settings across devices.

> [!CAUTION]
> The link contains your R2 access credentials. Do not share it on public platforms.

### Cache Optimization

R2 Web has built-in request caching for common operations like directory listings. For CDN caching, configure cache rules in the Cloudflare dashboard to improve load speeds.

## Technical Details

A pure frontend application with no build step — write code and deploy immediately.

**Core technologies:** HTML5/CSS3/ES6+, CSS Layers, native `<dialog>`, native Fetch, Import Maps, WebAssembly

**Dependencies:**

- `aws4fetch` — AWS4 request signing for R2 S3 API
- `dayjs` — date formatting
- `@jsquash/*` — WebAssembly image compression (MozJPEG, OxiPNG, libwebp, libavif)
- `qrcode` — QR code generation

**Not required:** Node.js, Webpack, Vite, React, Vue or any other build tool or framework — keeping the project lightweight and dependency-free.

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikiboss/r2-web.git
cd r2-web

# Install dependencies (for type hints only)
pnpm install

# Start local dev server
npx serve src
# or
python3 -m http.server 5500 --directory src
```

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the full development guide.

## FAQ

**Q: Are my credentials safe?**

A: Credentials are stored only in your browser's localStorage and are never sent to any server. Using a read-only API token is recommended.

**Q: Which browsers are supported?**

A: Modern browsers (latest Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari). No IE support.

**Q: Where does image compression happen?**

A: Local compression uses WebAssembly and runs entirely in your browser — no files are sent to any third-party server. If you use cloud compression (Tinify), images are sent to Tinify's servers.

**Q: Can I self-host?**

A: Yes — fork the repo, update `AllowedOrigins` in the CORS config to your domain, then deploy to any static hosting service (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

**Q: What does the config share link contain?**

A: It includes your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, bucket name, and other sensitive information. Do not share it publicly.

**Q: Why is my upload failing?**

A: Check that your CORS policy is correct, your credentials are valid, and that the file is under 300 MB (use rclone for large files).

## Roadmap

- Continuous UI/UX improvements and more shortcut actions

## Development Story

This project was built with Claude Opus 4.6 via vibe coding — entirely prompt-driven from requirements to implementation. See [plan.md](./plan.md) for the initial architecture and design prompts.
